 =================================
 
 DataGate projects allow you to design database and print files, and create 
 them on a target database.  To design a file, you add a file definition 
 source file to the project, then use the designer or XML editor to design the
 file.  When the design is complete, you can create a file in the database
 with the Create File command.  Your file definition remains in the project's
 source file, which allows you to create the file on other databases, and use
 modern source control tools to manage your file definitions.
 
 To begin, right click on the project node in Solution Explorer, and select 
 the "Add Item" command.  Then select from one  of the available templates for 
 creating DataGate files from "empty" file definitions.
 
 Alternatively, you can browse for files with DataGate Explorer, and drag-and-
 drop the files of your choice onto the project node in Solution Explorer.  
 When you do this, DataGate copies the definition of the file into a new file
 definition source file which is added to the project.
